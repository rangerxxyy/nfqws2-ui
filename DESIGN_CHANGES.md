# v0.6.0 visual audit

## Reference and existing UI

The XKeen UI source uses the variable Inter family for interface text and JetBrains Mono for code. This panel already packages both fonts and uses them in its Tailwind sans/mono stacks, so the audit keeps the same local font files and does not add a network font request. The panel also already has a shared keyboard accessible select, visible focus rings, light-theme select colors, panel transitions, and a reduced-motion mode.

## v0.6.0 adjustments

- Set the local Inter family and native dark/light color scheme on the document root so menus and controls follow the selected theme consistently.
- Set a comfortable shared line height and a 12 px minimum for explanatory and tabular text in every main panel. Small screens receive a little more line spacing.
- Give the existing custom select menu a short entrance transition and translucent depth while retaining its current keyboard, pointer, and selection behavior.
- Disable the select entrance animation when the user requests reduced motion.

## Panel audit

| Area | Existing pattern retained | v0.6.0 check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header and service state | Inter labels, semantic status colors, accessible action controls | Start/stop text and icon use a shared state presentation |
| Configuration and list editors | JetBrains Mono, line gutters, syntax coloring | Long values wrap or scroll within their editor; theme contrast remains explicit |
| Diagnosis and strategy picker | Ordered result cards and status tones | Explanations meet the shared minimum text size |
| Monitoring and Telegram | Responsive cards and status bars | Field labels and history remain readable on narrow screens |
| Appearance and backups | Theme/layout cards and grouped settings | Existing light/neon overrides stay scoped to their theme |
| About and release controls | Monospace commands and version pills | Focus, hover, and select states use the same shared interaction language |
